Extra feature(s) for the game:

1- Victory map expansion. The suggested expansion to the victory map which revolves around the mainland board of the game
says that there will be certain spots in the victory map. When a player is on a certain point-slot in the victory
map at the end of a round, the player will get a reward for phase one of the upcoming round. Each certain victory-point-spot will give specific rewards to the player that's on it. For instance, one will provide 
the player extra workers whereas another will provide extra coins. (Details specified later)

2- When a players territory is surrounded by three adjacent territories of another player, the building on that territory will be decreased by one level and if it is a simple dwelling, it will be destroyed. The attacker earns the loss of the victim, provided from the bank.
